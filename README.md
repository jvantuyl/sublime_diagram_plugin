# Overview

This is a plugin that renders diagrams from your selection in Sublime Text 2
or 3.

By default, it binds the (Command / Alt)-M key and registers a command on the
Command Palette.  Simple select the text for your diagram and trigger the
command.  Multiselections are allowed.  Each diagram will be generated in a
uniquely named file.

If a diagram handler recognizes a diagram in the selection, it will render it
and pop it up in a detected viewer.  All files are created in such a way that
they will be cleaned up unless Sublime Text dies a particularly horrible death.

If you wish to override the viewer used, create a user version of
Diagram.sublime-settings file in the usual way.

Sublime Text.

# Install Instructions

Check out the source directory or download and uncompress the source tarball.
Put this directoy in the Packages directory for your platform.

On Linux, it's sometimes "~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/".
On MacOS X, it's "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/".

Sublime Text should detect the plugin and automatically load it.

The source is available via git at:
